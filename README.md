## Hi there, I’m Richel

I’m a Master’s student in Statistics at Miami University, with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Time Series Analysis.

I’m passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and create impactful solutions, particularly in domains like health, energy, and transportation.

I currently work with Python and R, and I enjoy building clean, insightful, and practical data science projects. I'm also currently enrolled in the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng.

### Areas I’m interested in collaborating on:
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Time Series Forecasting
- Model Deployment (Streamlit, Flask)
- Data-driven decision-making projects

Let’s connect and collaborate on impactful work.
